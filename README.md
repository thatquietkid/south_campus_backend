This is the Flutter frontend for the **South Campus App** (University of Delhi). It interacts with a Go backend and presents a mobile interface for students to access academic info, cafeteria menus, event updates, bus schedules, hostel details, and more.

> \[!NOTE]
> The app fetches real-time data from a live backend hosted on [Render](https://render.com). Backend API: [https://south-campus-backend.onrender.com](https://south-campus-backend.onrender.com)

## 🌐 API Integration

The app uses `http` package to fetch data from:

* `/courses`
* `/cafeteria-items`
* `/bus-routes`
* `/events`
* `/complaints` (GET & POST)

These are consumed using custom service classes under `lib/services/`.

---

## 🔒 Authentication

Authentication is handled in the backend using JWT. Future versions of the app may include login flows for admin-only actions (e.g. adding cafeteria items).
